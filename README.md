my final project for freecodecamp's responsive web design.

I rushed this one since I really wanted to start making my own portfolio project.

So the design and technical side of things is pretty bad. I'm still grasping my head around responsiveness for mobile users since currently the images overflow when its very tiny, like 100-200px. I dont know if thats really important since mobiles have 700-ish px and i don't think anyone would view a website with a 100-200px width, so i dont really know.

besides i only did the bare minimum, maybe in a week i might have a fully (somewhat) fleshed out portfolio website, though i'm thinking i should wait until i at least know javascript and the basics of backend, or some of it so i can make it an official website.
